            Every time we hear of another Black or Brown person taken away from
            our community it hurts, because many of us know it can be prevented,
            and we know no one will be held accountable.
            <br /><br />
            Many of us want to protect our sisters, brothers, daughters,
            fathers, mothers, sons, grandparents and other loved ones from the
            very people who are sworn to keep us safe. Police in California kill
            almost 200 people every year, the majority of whom are people of
            color, and over 50% of them unarmed. This persistent and pervasive
            state violence is a violation of the public trust.

          Along with partners such as the ACLU, the Let Us Live Coalition and
          others, BLD PWR Founder Kendrick Sampson traveled to Sacramento
          alongside families that have lost loved ones to police violence,
          grassroots organizations such as Black Lives Matter and others to
          rally support, meet with lawmakers and fight for radical legislation
          that seriously raised the standards of police conduct and use of
          deadly force.
          <br />
          <br />
          BLD PWR also engaged influencers to amplify the Let Us Live campaign
          through social media and participation in a pair of powerful PSA
          videos, featuring voices from entertainment, sports and music as well
          as grassroots leaders and family members that are directly impacted.

            As AB 392 advanced, the overwhelming data and passionate community
            support carried it through multiple committee hearings, despite
            attacks and detractions by law enforcement. The original language of
            the bill included radical language that held officers criminally
            liable for using deadly force when there were other alternatives,
            defined what a necessary use of force would mean as well as
            mandating de-escalation in police encounters.

        <div class="box f-text">

            Eventually, the very powerful police union lobby and their influence
            with lawmakers created a very complex set of conditions in
            Sacramento, which led to significant changes in the language of the
            bill when it passed the Assembly. The bill is very likely to pass
            the State Senate and be signed into law, reportedly due to a deal
            forged by Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, Assembly Speaker
            Anthony Rendon and Gov. Gavin Newsom.

        <div class="box g-text">
          Though the compromised AB 392 is being celebrated as a victory, which
          changes the standards for law enforcement in California the fact is
          that the bill has significant changes. Most notably, the definition of
          “necessary” was removed, which effectively shifts responsibility to
          courts and prosecutors (who often rely on police to help them bring
          cases) to determine when an officer has used deadly force
          unnecessarily.
          <br /><br />This version of the bill lowers the likelihood that police
          will be held accountable for using deadly force, than its original
          intention.

        </div>

        <div class="i-text">
          <li>
            Update California’s use of force laws to the “necessary” standard,
            which will require that officers won’t use deadly force unless
            necessary to defend against an imminent threat of harm to themselves
            or others.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The bill’s definition of imminent threat will limit the likelihood
            that officers can claim there was a need to use deadly force simply
            because a person refused to follow commands.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The bill makes clear that officers must use other resources and
            techniques to resolve situations without using deadly force.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Apply the “necessary” standard to criminal liability, meaning
            District Attorneys could find officers criminally liable if they use
            deadly force unnecessarily.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Ensure officers are accountable for their conduct leading up to a
            shooting.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Restrict when officers can use deadly force on someone fleeing
            arrest.
          </li>

            It is the tireless organizing of families, communities and advocates
            which generated the momentum necessary to support Assemblymember
            Shirley Weber’s courageous fight to make the law reflect the will of
            the people. BLD PWR knows the road to liberation has many lanes, and
            legislation and policy is only one of them.
