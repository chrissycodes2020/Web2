          <p>
            BLD PWR engages culture, education and activism to build and train
            an inclusive community of entertainers and athletes to advance
            radical social change.
            <br><br> Partnering with grassroots causes and
            organizations, the purpose of BLD PWR is to increase action and
            civic engagement with a primary focus on uplifting and protecting
            the most vulnerable by undoing systemic oppression and combating
            state violence at the intersection of gender, immigration, economic,
            educational, environmental and racial justice movements. 
            <br><br>

          <p>
            Kendrick Sampson is an actor, activist and advocate for justice.
            Growing up in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, Kendrick gravitated to
            the arts and sought to bring to life nuanced portrayals of black men
            in his projects.
            <br><br> He is most known for the Vampire Diaries (CW),
            Gracepoint (FOX), How to Get Away with Murder (ABC), White Famous
            (Showtime), Supernatural (CW), The Flash (CW) and most recently his
            portrayal as Nathan in HBO’s critically acclaimed Insecure.
            Kendrick’s activism challenges by example to boldly use our voices
            to uplift the most vulnerable among us.

              With a primary focus on intersectional racial justice and undoing
              systemic oppression in the criminal legal system, Kendrick created
              the BLD PWR initiative as a call to action and invitation to
              others to join him in taking a stand for social justice.
